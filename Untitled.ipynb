    "# Part I: Data Question & Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Data Question:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since 2020 the use of telemedicine has skyrocketed and continues to be a key method for healthcare delivery. It has become a subject of interest to the broader healthcare industry, as evidenced by increased investments from healthcare companies as well as federal and state governments. For example, the Biden administration recently announced it will invest over 770 million for “telemedicine pods” in rural areas across the U.S. - 746,000 of this will be used for TN counties. A state task force dedicated to rural health outcomes recommended an additional 66,900 should be earmarked for expanding telemedicine capabilities in rural communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The potential applications for telemedicine are broad and emergent. Many doctors and therapists now offer live video calls for routine issues like medication management, mental health services, or follow-up care after a hospital stay. Other applications of telehealth, such as remote patient monitoring and mobile health applications, showcase the potential of telehealth to radically transform the healthcare landscape. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, there is much opportunity in rural applications of telehealth to address lack of accessibility. TN has a high rural population, with 82% of its counties classified as rural. According to the TN Rural Health Care Task Force, rural residents are at particular risk for “poor health outcomes, including mental health challenges, obesity, and substance misuse”. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on using data exploration and analysis to address the question: **``How can telehealth best be used to target health challenges in TN?``**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data Sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "The data sources include two publiclly available datasets on telehealth trends among medicare and medicaid recipients respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a robust dataset of various health factors and health outcomes collected in yearly datasets by the County Health Rankings & Roadmaps (CHR&R)  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. [Medicare Telehealth Trends](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/medicare-telemedicine-snapshot) (medicare_trends_df)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Medicare Telehealth Trends dataset provides information about people with Medicare who used telehealth services between January 1, 2020 and September 30, 2023. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data was also used to generate the [Medicare Telehealth Trends Report](https://data.cms.gov/sites/default/files/2024-03/Medicare%20Telehealth%20Trends%20Snapshot%2020240307_508.pdf).\n",

    "\n",
    "This data set includes monthly counts and rates (per 1,000 beneficiaries) of services provided via telehealth, including live audio video, remote patient monitoring, store and forward, and other telehealth, to Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries, by state. Data was collected between January 2018 and December 2022. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Some states have serious data quality issues for one or more months, making the data unusable for calculating telehealth services measures...Cells with a value of “DQ” (in the DataQuality column). indicate that data were suppressed due to unusable data. Additionally, some cells have a value of “DS”. This indicates that data were suppressed for confidentiality reasons because the group included fewer than 11 beneficiaries.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Overall:\n",
    "- National trend after covid is higher than before, although it has trended downward over last 3 years. \n",
    "\n",
    "Telehealth Types: \n",
    "- Live video/audio are by far the most used methods, however if we remove that variable you can see upwards trends in store & forward as well as remote patient monitoring. This suggests the focus is not just in how patients use technology but also how providers incorporate Telehealth into their available services. Adoption strategies may benefit from a focus on provider's technical literacy (not just patients)\n",
    "- Policy may also play a role. Many rural populations rely on medicaid or medicare for health care. A 2020 report outlines state medicaid policies as one of the challenges in using telehealth to address opioid addiction. The report includes a state readiness assessment for implementing telehealth delivery methods. An assessment of TN’s readiness reveals a few gaps in coverage. For example, the CCHP (Center for Connected Health Policy) has a helpful policy map comparison that shows TN is behind other states in allowing medicaid reimbursement for remote patient monitoring as well as “Store and Forward” medical diagnostic processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Macon, Overton, Haywood, and Polk Counties have a great need for Mental Health Providers\n",
    "[here](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/health-data/tennessee?year=2023&measure=Mental+Health+Providers&tab=0)\n",
    "#Haywood, Macon, Overton, Polk, and Morgan counties are the lowest 5 counties for Mental Health Provider Rates\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Out of all the demographic variables, the rate of mental health providers is most strongly correlated with higher percentages of rural populations*\n",
    "\n",
    "*rural populations are also strongly correlated with higher percentages of \"disconnected youths\" or children who are neither working nor in school.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*If we look at other factors such as: \n",
    "    - Children in Single Parent Household\n",
    "    - Children in Poverty\n",
    "\t- Uninsured Children\n",
    "    \n",
    "##### Consider that (at least according to the medicare data) younger people are much more likely to use telehealth services. This suggests that targeting high-risk rural youths for telehealth mental health services has a potential for high impact.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, its important to put these findings into context. Telelmedicine is not a replacement for in-person mental health treatment. Rather it is a good candidate for adding flexibility, continuity, and shoring up existing support-systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- Leverage behavioral health apps and social media groups/sites. For example, there is an app called Smart Recovery, that is geared towards recovering addicts. It provides self-help articles, a chat community, local support group information and scheduling (available both in person and online), a catalog of recovery tools and tips, and an interactive section that provides motivaitonal quotes and directed tasks to distract from addictive urges. There are also apps like betterhelp that provide counseling. Compiling a lsit of similar apps and distributing it to places such as schools, community centers, libraries, trade schools, community colleges, websites, etc, could help raise awareness of the available resources and improve outcomes. \n",
    " - Help providers improve their technical literacy and integrate telehealth techniques into their practice. For example, one barrier ot entry is scheduling an initial meeting with a provider. A lot of youth don't necessarily know how to set up their own appointments, and may become frustrated with phone scheduling. Online scheduling is much easier, and would allow patients to plan out future visits based on provider's transparent availability. \n",
    " - Another idea is allowing consultations that accomodate both live and store and forward techniques, so that those with limited internet can initiate treatment with a lower barrier\n",
    " - Promotion of Health Portals to facilitate provider and patient communication. This could include sending surveys, diagnostics, articles or resources related to mental health, prescription management, and case management (for patients with complex needs and multiple providers). \n",
    " - Having the option to switch between in person and telemedicine appointments as needed. Sometimes people cant get to the in person office. These shouldnt be pushed as the main method of treatment however, as in person treatment has distinct advantages. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Categories of Telemedicine](https://mdportal.com/education/telemedicine-categories/) \n",
    "\n",
    "- 'Mental health is another area that is rapidly adopting remote patient monitoring. Often, anomalies in patient’s physical movement patterns, and even shifts in patient’s mobile phone usage can act as a proxy for changes to their mental condition.
